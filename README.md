## Save Trees

&emsp;&emsp; Earth is the only known planet to support and sustain life. And trees are the vital elements that maintain a balance and fill the world with greenery, freshness and nourishment so plant trees and save earth for our future.

## Inspiration

&emsp;&emsp;Inspired by Jane Goodall braved a realm of unknowns to give the world a remarkable window into humankind’s closest living relatives. Through nearly 60 years of groundbreaking work, Dr. Jane Goodall has not only shown us the urgent need to protect chimpanzees from extinction; she has also redefined species conservation to include the needs of local people and the environment. Today she travels the world, speaking about the threats facing chimpanzees and environmental crises, urging each of us to take action on behalf of all living things and planet we share.
